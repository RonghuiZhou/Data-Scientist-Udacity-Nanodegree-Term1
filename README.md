2. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Scientist-Udacity-Nanodegree-/tree/master/Deep%20learning): Neural Networks, gradient descent, keras, deep learning with pytorch.

3. [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Scientist-Udacity-Nanodegree-/tree/master/Unsupervised%20Learning): Clustering, hierarchical and density-based clustering, gaussian mixture model, PCA, Random projections and ICA

#### Projects
1. [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Scientist-Udacity-Nanodegree-/tree/master/projects/p1_charityml): Use supervised learning algorithms such as Ensemble Methods adaboost, Decision tree, Guassian Naive Bayes to identify individuals making more than $50,000 income. Accuracy 86.7%.

2. [Image Classifier Project](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Scientist-Udacity-Nanodegree-/tree/master/projects/p2_image_classifier): Develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch to recognize diferent species of flowers.

3. [Identify Customer Segments](https://github.com/nesreensada/Data-Scientist-Udacity-Nanodegree-/tree/master/projects/p3_identify_customers_clusters): Used unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The data was provided by Arvato company which required data preprocessing, data reduction and clustering using Kmeans.
